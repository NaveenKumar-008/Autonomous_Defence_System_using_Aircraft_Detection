## AUTONOMOUS DEFENCE SYSTEM USING AIRCRAFT DETECTION
Detect and identify aircraft (both manned and unmanned) approaching a designated airspace.
Classify the threat level based on speed, altitude, flight pattern, and other relevant parameters.
Respond in real-time by alerting defense personnel or engaging automatic countermeasures to neutralize or mitigate the threat. 

## About
The project will also explore integration with existing aircraft systems, ensuring seamless communication and decision-making processes. Additionally, the scope includes rigorous testing in simulated environments to validate the performance and reliability of the autonomous defense system, ultimately contributing to improved aircraft safety and operational efficiency in complex and hostile scenarios.
